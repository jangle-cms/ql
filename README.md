Jangle QL
> The GraphQL layer for Jangle CMS.


### Overview

This is a __work in progress__, but the goal is to automatically generate a GraphQL endpoint for all of your content. This project converts your Jangle schemas into GraphQL schemas, and will use Jangle Core services to access your published content!

The best part is GraphIQL, the interface that makes creating custom queries nice and easy! Woohoo, GraphQL!


### Play around with it

1. `npm install`

1. `node examples/basic.js`
